    <h2><u>JavaScript</u></h2>

    JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive.<br>
    JavaScript will be the primary language used in the next few chapters. So study it well.<br><br>

    <h3>Let's start with an easy example</h3>

    <script>TBBOFBD.genCodeBlock(`// This is a comment, it will not be executed (ignored)
// A comment is used to explain what the code does

// This is how you declare a variable
var variableName = "Value"
// Let's break this down:
   var 
// ^^^ 
// This is the keyword that tells the computer that you are declaring a variable

   variableName
// ^^^^^^^^^^^^
// This is the name of the variable. It can be anything you want.
// However, try to make it descriptive so that you know what it is for.

   =
// ^
// This is the assignment operator. It tells the computer that you are assigning a value to the variable

   "Value"
// ^^^^^^
// This is the value that you are assigning to the variable. It can be anything you want.
// However, if you want it to be a string you have to use double quotes (") around it.

// Assembling the above code, we get:
var variableName = "Value"
// which the computer will interpret as:
// Declare a variable named variableName and assign it the value "Value"`,"javascript");</script>
